description: The game of Fiver begins with a grid of circles, green on one side and
  red on the other. Starting with all green, each move flips a circle and its four
  adjacent circles, until all of the circles are red. Optimizing the Fiver solution
  (solving in the fewest number of moves) is used in Lecture 10 to illustrate Integer
  Programming techniques. Image by Prof. James Orlin.
